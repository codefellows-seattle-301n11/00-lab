##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I made these determinations based on the general guidelines posted in the SMACSSify Exercise lab.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not do any refactoring of the existing CSS. The code did not seem to need very much, if any, refactoring from what I could see.
