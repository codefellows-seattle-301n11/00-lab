##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?


I followed the sample within the instructions README file.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No I didnt have to refactor anything, but I have run into github error code 403 and have to do a git remote set-url.
