##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(Put your answer here)
Based on my understanding of SMACSS, I moved the css over to the new individual files.  The body and main are in the base. The header, footer and aside was put into layout.  List images and paragraphs were placed into modules.
