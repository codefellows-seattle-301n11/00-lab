##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I moved the CSS into the individual files according to instructions.  Body and main in base.  Header footer nav and aside into layout. Lists images and paragraphs into modules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I didn't do any refactoring on this project but am looking forward to useing new naming techniques in the future.
